Your task is to translate English instructions into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Q: What is "Visit a, then visit b." in LTL?
A: F(a & F(a & Fb))

Q: What is "Visit landmark a, then landmark b, and finally landmark c in that order." in LTL?
A: F(a & F(b & Fc))

Q: What is "Visit a, then visit b, then visit c, then visit d." in LTL?
A: F(a & F(b & F(c & Fd)))

Q: What is "Visit landmarks a, b, c, d, and h in sequence." in LTL?
A: F(a & F(b & F(c & F(d & Fh))))

Q: What is "Visit landmark a exactly once and then visit landmark b while avoiding landmark b until after visiting landmark a." in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & Fb & (!a U (a U (!a U b)))

Q: What is "Visit landmark a exactly once, then visit landmark b exactly once, and finally visit landmark c. Avoid landmarks b and c while visiting landmark a." in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c)))

Q: What is "Visit a, then b, then c, and finally d. You must visit each landmark exactly once." in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d)))

Q: What is "Visit landmarks a, b, c, d, and h in that order without revisiting any landmark." in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d))) & (!d U (d U (!d U h)))

Q: What is "Visit landmark "a" an infinite number of times." in LTL?
A: GFa

Q: What is "Infinitely visit landmarks a, b, and c in any order." in LTL?
A: GFa & GFb & GFc

Q: What is "Infinitely visit landmarks a, b, c, and d in any order." in LTL?
A: GFa & GFb & GFc & GFd

Q: What is "Always visit a, b, c, d, and h in any order infinitely many times." in LTL?
A: GFa & GFb & GFc & GFd & GFh
