We combine the four parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “F & a F & b F & c F & d”., F & a F & b F & c F d
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has four landmarks “a”, "b", "c", and "d". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "then" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint. We first visit "a", then "b", then "c", and then "d". We must “visit a” at some point in time. This requires the "F" operator. We must visit other landmarks after "a" which requires the "&" operator. This corresponds to the prefix part “F & a”. Similarly, “then b”, “then c”, and “then d” tell us we must visit the other landmarks some time after visiting “a” which is the prefix part “F & b”, “F & c”, and “F & d”, respectively. We must also make sure that each landmark is visited only once which requires the "!" operator. This is the prefix part “! a ! b ! c ! d”. We combine the four parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “F & a F & b F & c F & d ! a ! b ! c ! d”., & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has one landmark “a”. Looking at parts of the instruction, it contains no temporal constraint on visiting the landmark as long as it is "visited infinitely often". Visiting the landmark "infinitely often" requires the "G" operator with "F". So the answer is “G F a”., G F a
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has four landmarks “a”, "b", "c", and "d". Looking at parts of the instruction, it contains no temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks as long as they are "frequent infinitely". The landmarks only require that they are eventually visited again in the future. This requires the "F" operator. Visiting the landmarks "infinitely" in the future requires the "G" operator with "F". The instruction also contains the phrase "in any order" which implies that we can visit the landmarks in no particular order. This requires the "&" operator. So the answer is “& G F a & G F b & G F c & G F d”., & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has four landmarks “a”, "b", "c", and "d". Looking at parts of the instruction, it contains no temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks. We must visit all the landmarks eventually which requires the "F" operator. So the answer is “F a F b F c F d”., & F a & F b & F c F d
