We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order and "before" specifies that we cannot visit a landmark until we visit another first. Combining this logic, we only visit one landmark after visiting another and never go back to previously visited landmarks. "We eventually visit h but not until we visit d and we visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a.
