The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & F(a & F(b & F(c & Fd)))"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "in sequence" specifies we must visit "a and then visit b and then visit c and then visit d and then visit h, eventually". "while avoiding the next landmark in the sequence" specifies we cannot visit the next landmark until we visit the current landmark. Working backwards, "eventually, visit h" is "Fh". "eventually, visit d and then visit h" is "F(d & Fh)". "eventually, visit c and then d and then visit h" is "F(c & F(d & Fh))". Keep doing this until we reach the first landmark. The answer is "F(a & F(b & F(c & F(d & Fh))))"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h
