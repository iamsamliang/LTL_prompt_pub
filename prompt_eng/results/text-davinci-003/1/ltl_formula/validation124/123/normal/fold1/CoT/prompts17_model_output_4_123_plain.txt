"We eventually visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a. We cannot visit any landmark until we visit the previous landmark". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "visit d but not until we visit c" is "(!d U c)". "eventually visit d" is "Fd". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "while avoiding" and "then" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a. We cannot visit b until we visit a and we cannot visit c until we visit b and we cannot visit d until we visit c". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "visit d but not until we visit c" is "(!d U c)". "eventually visit d" is "Fd". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order and "you cannot visit...before" specifies that we cannot visit a landmark until we visit another. Combining this logic, we only visit one landmark after visiting another and never go back to previously visited landmarks. "We eventually visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "visit d but not until we visit c" is "(!d U c)". "eventually visit d" is "Fd". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d
