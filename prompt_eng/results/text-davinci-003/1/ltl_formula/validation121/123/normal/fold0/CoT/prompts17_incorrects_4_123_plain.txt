The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd".

(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd, F & a F & b F & c F d, sequenced_visit, 4, travel to a then travel to b then go to c then reach d, We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order. "We eventually visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit d" is "Fd". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd".

(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c), F & a F & b F & c F d, sequenced_visit, 4, travel from a to b to c to d, We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "to" specifies we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c)".

(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd, F & a F & b F & c F d, sequenced_visit, 4, first go to a then visit b then move to c finally reach d, We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "first" and "then" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit d" is "Fd". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd".
