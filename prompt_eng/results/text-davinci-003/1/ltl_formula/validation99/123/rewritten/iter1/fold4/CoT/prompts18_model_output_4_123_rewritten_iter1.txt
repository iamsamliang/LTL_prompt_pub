We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "in sequence" and "until" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "staying away from the next landmark" specifies we cannot visit the next landmark until we visit the current landmark. "without revisiting any previous landmarks" specifies we never go back to previously visited landmarks. Combining this logic, we only visit one landmark after visiting another and never go back to previously visited landmarks. "We eventually visit the final landmark but not until we visit the previous landmark. We visit each landmark only once except for the last landmark". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit the final landmark" is "Ffinal". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). "visit b only once" is (!b U (b U (!b U c))). Repeat for the remaining landmarks except for the final landmark. The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!final U c) & Ffinal & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U final)))"., & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d h
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "without stopping" and "then" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "only once" specifies that we visit a landmark only once. "We eventually visit H but not until we visit D and we visit D but not until we visit C and we visit C but not until we visit B and we eventually visit B but not until we visit A.

Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit H" is "Fh". "visit A only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). "visit B only once" is (!b U (b U (!b U c))).

We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we must visit "a and then visit b and then visit c, eventually". Working backwards, "eventually, visit c" is "Fc". "eventually, visit b and then visit c" is "F(b & Fc)". "eventually, visit a and then visit b and then visit c" is "F(a & F(b & Fc))". We reached the first landmark so we are done. The answer is "F(a & F(b & Fc))"., F & a F & b F c
