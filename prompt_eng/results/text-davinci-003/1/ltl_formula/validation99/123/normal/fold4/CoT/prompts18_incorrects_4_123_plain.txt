After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "in that specific order" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order and "only visit...one time" specifies that we visit a landmark only once. Combining this logic, we only visit one landmark after visiting another and never go back to previously visited landmarks. "We eventually visit h but not until we visit d and we visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we eventually visit b but not until we visit a. We visit each landmark only once except for the last landmark, h". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit h" is "Fh". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). "visit b only once" is (!b U (b U (!b U c))). Repeat for the remaining landmarks except for landmark h. The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d)))".

After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "while staying away from" and "then" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "without returning to any previously visited locations" specifies that we never go back to previously visited landmarks. "We eventually visit h but not until we visit d and we visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we eventually visit b but not until we visit a.

Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit h" is "Fh". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). "visit b only once" is (!b U (b U (!b U c))).

(!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc, F & a F & b F c, sequenced_visit, 3, go to a b c make sure to go to b after a and c after b, We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "after" specifies we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "eventually visit c" is "Fc". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc".

(!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc, F & a F & b F c, sequenced_visit, 3, visit a then go to b finally make your way to c, We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" and "finally" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "eventually visit c" is "Fc". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc".

(!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc, F & a F & b F c, sequenced_visit, 3, go to a then head to b finally go to c, We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" and "finally" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "eventually visit c" is "Fc". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc".
