"We eventually visit h but not until we visit d and we visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we eventually visit b but not until we visit a. We visit each landmark only once except for the last landmark, h". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit h" is "Fh". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). "visit b only once" is (!b U (b U (!b U c))). Repeat for the remaining landmarks except for landmark h. The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d)))"., & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c & U ! c U c U ! c d U ! d U d U ! d h
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "without visiting" and "then" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "only one time" specifies that we visit a landmark only once. Combining this logic, we only visit one landmark after visiting another and never go back to previously visited landmarks. "We eventually visit h but not until we visit d and we visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we eventually visit b but not until we visit a.

We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we must visit "a and then visit b and then visit c, eventually". Working backwards, "eventually, visit c" is "Fc". "eventually, visit b and then visit c" is "F(b & Fc)". "eventually, visit a and then visit b and then visit c" is "F(a & F(b & Fc))". We reached the first landmark so we are done. The answer is "F(a & F(b & Fc))"., F & a F & b F c

"after" specifies we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "eventually visit c" is "Fc".
