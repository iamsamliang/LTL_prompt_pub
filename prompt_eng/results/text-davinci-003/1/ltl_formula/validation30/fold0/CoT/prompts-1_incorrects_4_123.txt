(!b U a) & Fb,F & a F b,sequenced_visit,2,eventually first visit a and then b after
Fa & Fb,F & a F b,sequenced_visit,2,visit a and then b
(!b U a) & Fb,F & a F b,sequenced_visit,2,go to a and sometime afterward visit b
(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c),F & a F & b F & c F d,sequenced_visit,4,visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d 
(!b U a) & Fb,F & a F b,sequenced_visit,2,move to a then move to b
(!b U a) & Fb,F & a F b,sequenced_visit,2,go to a then b
(!b U a) & Fb,F & a F b,sequenced_visit,2,find a first then find b
(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh,& F a & F b & F c & F d F h,visit,5,go to a go to b go to c go to d go to h
(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd,F & a F & b F & c F d,sequenced_visit,4,go to a and then go to b and then go to c and then go to d
