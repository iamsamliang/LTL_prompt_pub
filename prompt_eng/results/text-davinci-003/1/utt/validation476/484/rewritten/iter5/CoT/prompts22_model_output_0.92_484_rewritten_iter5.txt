There are no other landmarks so we are done. The answer is "GFa & GFb"., & G F a G F b
We must eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order and do so forever. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "alternate" specifies we must "eventually visit a and then b and then a and then b forever". Examining each part, "eventually visit a and then b" is "F(a & Fb)". "eventually visit a and then b and then a and then b forever" is "G(F(a & Fb))". We reached the first landmark so we are done. The answer is "G(F(a & Fb))"., & G F a G F b
We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order and do so forever. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "Always" specifies we must "eventually visit a and b forever". Examining each part, "eventually visit a forever" is "GFa". "eventually visit b forever" is "GFb". There are no other landmarks so we are done. The answer is "GFa & GFb"., & G F a G F b
