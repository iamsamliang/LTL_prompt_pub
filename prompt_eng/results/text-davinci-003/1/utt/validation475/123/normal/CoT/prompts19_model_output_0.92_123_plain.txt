There are no other landmarks so we are done. The answer is "GFa & GFb"., & G F a G F b

We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order and do so forever. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "keep visiting" specifies we must "eventually visit a and b forever". Examining each part, "eventually visit a forever" is "GFa". "eventually visit b forever" is "GFb". We reached the first landmark so we are done. The answer is "GFa & GFb"., & G F a G F b
We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order and do so forever. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "infinite number of times" specifies we must "eventually visit a and b forever". Examining each part, "eventually visit a forever" is "GFa". "eventually visit b forever" is "GFb". There are 2 landmarks so we are done. The answer is "GFa & GFb"., & G F a G F b
We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order and do so forever. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "repeatedly visit" specifies we must "eventually visit a and b forever". Examining each part, "eventually visit a forever" is "GFa". "eventually visit b forever" is "GFb". The answer is "GFa & GFb"., & G F a G F b
