The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U (b & !d)) & (!d U c)".

((b & !c) U a) & ((c & !d) U (b & !c)) & Fd, & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d, ordered_visit, 4, Visit a, then visit b without visiting c, then visit c without visiting d, and finally visit d., We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "without visiting" specifies we cannot visit a landmark until we visit another first. "We visit a, then visit b without visiting c, then visit c without visiting d, and finally visit d". Examining each part, "visit b without visiting c" is "(b & !c) U a". "visit c without visiting d" is "(c & !d) U (b & !c)". "eventually visit d" is "Fd". We reached the first landmark so we are done. The answer is "((b & !c) U a) & ((c & !d) U (b & !c)) & Fd".

(!b U a) & (G(!c) & (!b U c)) & (G(!d) & (!c U d)) & Fd, & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d, ordered_visit, 4, First, avoid landmark b and go to landmark a. Then, while staying away from landmark c, go to landmark b. After that, while avoiding landmark d, go to landmark c. Finally, visit landmark d., We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "while avoiding" and "then" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "First, avoid landmark b and go to landmark a" is "(!b U a)". "while staying away from landmark c, go to landmark b" is "(G(!c) & (!b U c))". "while avoiding landmark d, go to landmark c" is "(G(!d) & (!c U d))". "Finally, visit landmark d" is "Fd". The answer is "(!b U a) & (G(!c) & (!b U c)) & (G(!d) & (!c U d)) & Fd".
