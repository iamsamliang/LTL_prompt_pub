as, F a, visit, 1, Arrive at landmark "a"., Arriving at landmark "a" is a one-time event. We can represent it as "a" or "F a". The first formula means "a is true now" and the second formula means "eventually a will be true". Both formulas are equivalent for this case.

 landmark a" is "Fa", which means "eventually, in the future, landmark a will be visited, F a, visit, 1, Eventually, visit landmark "a"., The LTL formula for "Eventually, visit landmark a" is "Fa", which means "eventually, in the future, landmark a will be visited".

Xa, F a, visit, 1, Arrive at landmark "a"., Arriving at landmark "a" is a one-time event. We can represent it using the "X" LTL operator, which means "next". The formula for arriving at landmark "a" is "Xa".

a -> b, & F a F b, visit, 2, First, visit landmark a. Then, visit landmark b., We must visit landmarks in a specific order. "Then" specifies we must "visit a and then visit b". Working backwards, "visit b" is "b". "visit a and then visit b" is "a -> b". The answer is "a -> b".

(!a U b) & (!b U a), & F a F b, visit, 2, Visit either landmark a or landmark b, and then visit the other landmark., We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "either...or" specifies we visit one landmark or the other. "and then" specifies we visit the other landmark after visiting the first. "We eventually visit a or b but not until we visit the other landmark first". Examining each part, "visit a but not until visit b" is "(!a U b)". "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". The answer is "(!a U b) & (!b U a)".

 can represent it as "a, F a, visit, 1, Arrive at landmark "a"., Arriving at landmark "a" is a one-time event. We can represent it as "a".

 requires a more detailed description of the system and the behavior that needs to be specifie, F a, visit, 1, Move towards landmark "a"., This instruction is not specific enough to be translated into LTL. LTL is a logic language used to specify temporal properties of systems. It requires a more detailed description of the system and the behavior that needs to be specified.

F(a & Fb), & F a F b, visit, 2, Visit a and then visit b., We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we must visit "a and then visit b". Working backwards, "eventually, visit b" is "Fb". "eventually, visit a and then visit b" is "F(a & Fb)". We reached the first landmark so we are done. The answer is "F(a & Fb)".

F(a & Fb), & F a F b, visit, 2, Visit a and then visit b., We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator.

We reached the first landmark so we are done. The answer is "F(a & Fb)".

nstruction would simply be "Fa & Fb", which means "eventually visit a and eventually visit b, & F a F b, visit, 2, Locate landmarks a and b., This instruction only specifies that we must locate landmarks a and b, but it does not specify any order or frequency. Therefore, the LTL formula for this instruction would simply be "Fa & Fb", which means "eventually visit a and eventually visit b".

"First, visit landmark a once" is "(!a U (a & (!b U (!c U (!d U true)))))". "Then, visit landmark b once while avoiding landmark c" is "(!b U (b & (!c U (!d U true))))". "After that, visit landmark c once while avoiding landmark d" is "(!c U (c & (!d U true)))". "Finally, visit landmark d" is "Fd". The answer is "(!a U (a & (!b U (!c U (!d U true))))) & (!b U (b & (!c U (!d U true)))) & (!c U (c & (!d U true))) & Fd".

(!b U (a & !c)) & (!c U (b & !d)) & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d))) & (!d U (d U (!d))), & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d, strictly_ordered_visit, 4, Visit a, then visit b without visiting c, then visit c without visiting d, and finally visit d while only visiting each location once., We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order and "only once" specifies that we visit a landmark only once. Combining this logic, we only visit one landmark after visiting another and never go back to previously visited landmarks. "We visit a, then visit b without visiting c, then visit c without visiting d, and finally visit d. We visit each landmark only once". Examining each part, "visit b without visiting c" is "(!b U (a & !c))". "visit c without visiting d" is "(!c U (b & !d))". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). Repeat for the remaining landmarks. The answer is "(!b U (a & !c)) & (!c U (b & !d)) & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d))) & (!d U (d U (!d)))".

After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "in that strict order" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order and "without returning to any previously visited locations" specifies that we visit a landmark only once. "We eventually visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a. We visit each landmark only once". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "visit d but not until we visit c" is "(!d U c)". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). "visit b only once" is (!b U (b U (!b U c))). Repeat for the remaining landmarks. The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d))) & G(!a & !b & !c & !d)".
