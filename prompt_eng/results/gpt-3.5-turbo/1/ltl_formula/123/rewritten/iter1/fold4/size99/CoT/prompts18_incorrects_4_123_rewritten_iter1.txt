Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order. "We visit a, then b, and finally c". Examining each part, "visit b after a" is "Fa -> Fb". "visit c after b" is "Fb -> Fc". We reached the last landmark so we are done. The answer is "Fa -> Fb & Fb -> Fc".

Fa -> Fb & Fb -> Fc, F & a F & b F c, sequenced_visit, 3, First, visit landmark a. Then, proceed to landmark b. Finally, visit landmark c., We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order. "We visit a first, then b, and finally c". Examining each part, "visit b after a" is "Fa -> Fb". "visit c after b" is "Fb -> Fc". We reached the last landmark so we are done. The answer is "Fa -> Fb & Fb -> Fc".
