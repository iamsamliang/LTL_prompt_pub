"without stopping" specifies we cannot visit a landmark until we visit another first. "First, visit A without stopping at B. Then, visit B" means "visit A but not until visit B" is "(!a U b)" and "eventually visit B" is "Fb". The answer is "(!a U b) & Fb"., & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order and "without visiting...again" specifies that we never go back to previously visited landmarks. "We first visit a and then visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). The answer is "(!b U a) & (!a U (a U (!a U b)))"., & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. After we visit a landmark, we never visit it again. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "once" specifies that we visit a landmark only once. "We visit landmark a once and then reach landmark b". Examining each part, "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U b)). "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". The answer is "(!a U (a U b)) & (!b U a)"., & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "only after" and "avoiding" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another and we never visit a certain landmark. "We eventually visit b but not until we visit a once and we never visit b before visiting a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a once" is "(a U b)". "never visit b before visiting a" is "(!b U a)". The answer is "(a U b) & (!b U a)"., & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U ! a b
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order. "H must be visited before d" specifies that we cannot visit d until we visit h first. "We eventually visit a, then b, then c, then h, and then d". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "visit h but not until visit c" is "(!h U c)". "visit d but not until we visit h" is "(!d U h)". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!h U c) & (!d U h) & Fd"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "before" specifies we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit h but not until we visit d and we visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we eventually visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit h" is "Fd". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fd"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order. "You cannot visit b before a, c before b, d before c, or h before d" specifies that we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We visit a, then b, then c, and finally d". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "visit d but not until we visit c" is "(!d U c)". "eventually visit d" is "Fd". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). "visit b only once" is (!b U (b U (!b U c))). Repeat for the remaining landmarks except for landmark d. The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d)))"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h
We must eventually visit a landmark while avoiding some other landmarks. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "while avoiding" specifies we must avoid some landmarks. "Eventually reach h" is "Fh". "Avoid b" is "!(b)". "Avoid c" is "!(c)". "Avoid d" is "!(d)". Combining these, "Eventually reach h while avoiding b, c, and d" is "Fh & !(b) & !(c) & !(d)"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h
We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we visit landmarks in a specific order. "We visit a, then visit b, then visit c, then visit d, and finally visit h". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit h but not until we visit d" is "(!h U d)". We reached the last landmark so we are done. The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh"., & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c & U ! h d F h
