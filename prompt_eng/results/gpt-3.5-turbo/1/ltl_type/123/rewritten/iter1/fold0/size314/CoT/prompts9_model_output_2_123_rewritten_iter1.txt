We must eventually visit some landmarks in a specific order while visiting each location only once. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "Visit a, then visit b, then visit c, and finally visit d" is equivalent to "a -> (b -> (c -> Fd))". This means that if we visit a, then we must eventually visit b, and if we visit b, then we must eventually visit c, and if we visit c, then we must eventually visit d. Additionally, we must visit each location only once. We can express this as "G((a -> X(!b & !c & !d)) & (b -> X(!a & !c & !d)) & (c -> X(!a & !b & !d)) & (d -> X(!a & !b & !c)))". This means that at any point in time, if we are at a, then we cannot be at b, c, or d in the next step, and so on for the other locations. The final LTL formula is:, & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d

Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit d" is "Fd". We also need to specify that we cannot revisit any location. This can be done using the "G" LTL operator for globally, which means "always". We can say "G((a & !b & !c & !d) | (!a & b & !c & !d) | (!a & !b & c & !d) | (!a & !b & !c & d))". This means that at any point in time, we are either at location a and have not visited any other location, or we are at location b and have only visited location a, or we are at location c and have only visited locations a and b, or we are at location d and have only visited locations a, b, and c. The final LTL formula is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd & G((a & !b & !c & !d) | (!a & b & !c & !d) | (!a & !b & c & !d) | (!a & !b & !c & d))"., & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U ! a b & U ! b U b U ! b c U ! c U c U ! c d
