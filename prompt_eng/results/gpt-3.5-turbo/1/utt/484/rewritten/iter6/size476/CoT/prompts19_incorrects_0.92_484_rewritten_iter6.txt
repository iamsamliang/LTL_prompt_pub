 a landmark" can be translated to LTL as "Fa", which means "eventually, a will be visited, F a, visit, 1, Eventually, visit a landmark., "Eventually, visit a landmark" can be translated to LTL as "Fa", which means "eventually, a will be visited".

r example, we could add "eventually reach landmark a" to the instruction, in which case the LTL formula would be "Fa, F a, visit, 1, Move towards landmark "a"., This instruction is not specific enough to be translated into LTL.
