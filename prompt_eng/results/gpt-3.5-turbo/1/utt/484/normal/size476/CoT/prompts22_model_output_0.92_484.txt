We must keep visiting some landmarks in a certain order forever. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "without stopping" specifies we must "keep visiting a and b forever". Examining each part, "keep visiting a forever" is "G(a & Fb)". There are only two landmarks so we are done. The answer is "G(a & Fb)"., & G F a G F b
We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order and do so forever. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "an infinite number of times" specifies we must "eventually visit a and b forever". Examining each part, "eventually visit a forever" is "GFa". "eventually visit b forever" is "GFb". The answer is "GFa & GFb"., & G F a G F b
We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order and do so forever. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "keep visiting" specifies we must "eventually visit a and b forever". Examining each part, "eventually visit a and b forever" is "G(Fa & Fb)". There are 2 landmarks so we are done. The answer is "G(Fa & Fb)"., & G F a G F b
We must eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "back and forth" specifies we must "eventually visit a and then visit b and then visit a and then visit b, and so on, forever". Examining each part, "eventually visit a and then visit b, and so on, forever" is "G(Fa & F(b & G(Fa))))". There are only 2 landmarks so we are done. The answer is "G(Fa & F(b & G(Fa))))"., & G F a G F b
We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order and do so forever. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. Forever is the "G" LTL operator. "an infinite number of times" specifies we must "keep visiting a and b forever". Examining each part, "keep visiting a forever" is "G(a & Ga)". "keep visiting b forever" is "G(b & Gb)". The answer is "G(a & Ga) & G(b & Gb)"., & G F a G F b
