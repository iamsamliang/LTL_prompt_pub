The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has two landmarks “a” and "b". It contains no temporal constraint on visiting "a" or "b". Looking at parts of the instruction, "in an arbitrary order" implies that we can visit “a” and "b" in no particular order but that we eventually must visit both which requires the "F" operator. So the answer is “& F a F b”., & F a F b
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has five landmarks “a”, "b", "c", "d", and "h". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "then" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint. We first visit "a", then "b", then "c", then "d", and finally "h". We must “go to a” at some point in time. This requires the "F" operator. We must visit other landmarks after "a" which requires the "&" operator. This corresponds to the prefix part “F & a”. Similarly, “then go to b” tells us we must visit “b" some time after visiting “a” which is the prefix part “F & b”. We must visit "c" and "d" after "b" which is the prefix part “F & c F & d”. Lastly, we must visit "h" after "c" and "d" which is the prefix part “F h”. We combine the five parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “F & a F & b F & c F & d F h”., F & a F & b F & c F & d F h
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has three landmarks “a”, "b", and "c". Looking at parts of the instruction, it contains no temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks. We must eventually visit all three landmarks which requires the "F" operator. So the answer is “& F a F b F c”., & F a & F b F c
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has two landmarks “a” and "b". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "exactly once" phrase indicates there is a temporal constraint on visiting "a". We must visit "a" exactly once which requires the "X" operator. We must also avoid "b" which requires the "!" operator. This is the prefix part “X ! a”. We must still visit "b" eventually which is the prefix part "F b". We combine the two parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “X ! a F b”., & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has four landmarks “a”, "b", "c", and "d". Looking at parts of the instruction, it contains no temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks as long as they are "frequent infinitely". The landmarks only require that they are eventually visited again in the future. This requires the "F" operator. Visiting the landmarks "infinitely" in the future requires the "G" operator with "F". The instruction also contains the phrase "in any order" which implies that we can visit the landmarks in no particular order. This requires the "&" operator. So the answer is “& G F a & G F b & G F c & G F d”., & G F a & G F b & G F c G F d

The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has two landmarks “a” and "b". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "then" phrase indicates there is a temporal constraint. We first visit "a", then "b". We must “go to a” at some point in time. This requires the "F" operator. We must visit "b" after "a" which requires the "&" operator. This corresponds to the prefix part “F & a”. We must not return to "a" which requires the "!" operator. This is the prefix part “! a”. We must still visit "b" eventually which is the prefix part "F b". We combine the three parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “F & a ! a F b”., & & U ! b a F b U ! a U a U !a b
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has four landmarks “a”, "b", "c", and "d". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "then" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint.

This corresponds to the prefix part “F & a”. Similarly, “then go to b”, “then go to c”, and “then go to d” tell us we must visit the respective landmarks some time after visiting “a” which is the prefix part “F & b”, “F & c”, and “F & d”, respectively. We must also make sure that each landmark is visited only once which requires the "X" operator. So the answer is “F & a X F & b X F & c X F & d”., & & U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d & U ! a U a U !a b & U ! b U b U !b c U ! c U c U !c d
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has three landmarks “a”, "b", and "c". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "then" and "finally" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint. We first visit "a" exactly once while avoiding "b" and "c", then visit "b" exactly once while avoiding "c", and finally visit "c". We must visit "a" exactly once which requires the "X" operator. We must avoid "b" and "c" which requires the "!" operator. This is the prefix part “X ! a ! b ! c”. We must visit "b" exactly once which requires the "X" operator. We must avoid "c" which requires the "!" operator. This is the prefix part “X ! b ! c”. We must visit "c" eventually which is the prefix part "F c". We combine the three parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “X ! a ! b ! c X ! b ! c F c”., & & U ! b a & U ! c b F c & U ! a U a U !a b U ! b U b U !b c

So the answer is “& G F a G F b”., & G F a G F b
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has five landmarks “a”, "b", "c", "d", and "h". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "in this order" phrase indicates there is a temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks. We must visit "a", then "b", then "c", then "d", and then "h". We must “visit a” at some point in time. This requires the "F" operator. We must visit other landmarks after "a" which requires the "&" operator. This corresponds to the prefix part “F & a”. Similarly, “visit b”, “visit c”, and “visit d” tell us we must visit the respective landmarks some time after visiting “a” which is the prefix part “F & b”, “F & c”, and “F & d”, respectively. Lastly, “visit h” tells us we must visit "h" some time after visiting "a", "b", "c", and "d" which is the prefix part “F h”. We combine the five parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “F & a F & b F & c F & d F h”., F & a F & b F & c F & d F h
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has five landmarks “a”, "b", "c", "d", and "h".

The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has two landmarks “a” and "b". It contains no temporal constraint on visiting "a" or "b". Looking at parts of the instruction, we must visit both landmarks which requires the "&" operator. We must also visit both landmarks eventually which requires the "F" operator. So the answer is “& F a F b”., & F a F b
The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has three landmarks “a”, "b", and "c". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "until" and "only once" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks. “do not visit c until you visit b” means we cannot go to “c” until we go to "b" which requires the "U" and "!" operator. There are landmarks to visit after "b" which requires "&". This is the prefix part “& U ! c b”. “visit b only once” implies we must visit "b" only once which requires the "X" operator. This is the prefix part “X b”. “do no visit b until you visit a” and "visit a only once" follow the same reasoning with different landmarks. This is the prefix part “& U ! b a” and "X a", respectively. We must still visit "c" eventually which is the prefix part "F c". We combine the four parts while maintaining prefix notation.
