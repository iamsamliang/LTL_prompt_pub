Your task is to translate English instructions into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Q: What is "reach a" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "reach" specifies we must "eventually visit a". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". There is 1 landmark so we are done. The answer is "Fa".

Q: What is "visit c a and b in no specific order" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "visit" specifies we must "eventually visit a, b, and c". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". Repeat for the remaining parts. The answer is "Fa & Fb & Fc".

Q: What is "move to a b c and d in any order" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "move to" specifies we must "eventually visit a, b, c, and d". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". Repeat for the remaining parts. The answer is "Fa & Fb & Fc & Fd".

Q: What is "make sure a b c d and h are all visited" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "are all visited" specifies we must "eventually visit a, b, c, d, and h". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". Repeat for the remaining parts. The answer is "Fa & Fb & Fc & Fd & Fh".

Q: What is "visit a and then b" in LTL?
A: We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we must "visit a and then visit b, eventually". Working backwards, "eventually, visit b" is "Fb". "eventually, visit a and then visit b" is "F(a & Fb)". We reached the first landmark so we are done. The answer is "F(a & F(a & Fb))".

Q: What is "in some sequence visit a b and c in that order" in LTL?
A: We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "in that order" specifies we must visit "a and then visit b and then visit c, eventually". Working backwards, "eventually, visit c" is "Fc". "eventually, visit b and then visit c" is "F(b & Fc)". "eventually, visit a and then b and then visit c" is "F(a & F(b & Fc))".

Working backwards, "eventually, visit d" is "Fd". "eventually, visit c and then visit d" is "F(c & Fd)". "eventually, visit b and then c and then visit d" is "F(b & F(c & Fd))". Keep doing this until we reach the first landmark. The answer is "F(a & F(b & F(c & Fd)))".

Q: What is "go to a then go to b then go to c then go to d finally go to h" in LTL?
A: We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "then" specifies we must visit "a and then visit b and then visit c and then visit d and then visit h, eventually". Working backwards, "eventually, visit h" is "F h". "eventually, visit d and then visit h" is "F(d & F h)". "eventually, visit c and then d and then visit h" is "F(c & F(d & Fh))". Keep doing this until we reach the first landmark. The answer is "F(a & F(b & F(c & F(d & Fh))))".

Q: What is "do not go to c until you visit b and do not go to b until you visit a and make sure you visit c" in LTL?
A: We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator.

Q: What is "go to a only once but keep away from b and then visit b but keep away from a" in LTL?

Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "keep away" and "then" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "only once" specifies we visit a landmark only once. "We eventually visit b but not until we visit a. We visit each landmark only once except for the last landmark, b". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". "visit a only once" is (!a U (a U (!a U b))). There are no other landmarks remaining besides the last landmark b so we are done. The answer is "(!b U a) & Fb & (!a U (a U (!a U b)))".
