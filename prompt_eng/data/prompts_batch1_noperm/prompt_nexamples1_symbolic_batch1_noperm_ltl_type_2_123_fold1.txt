Your task is to translate English instructions into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Q: What is "visit a and then b" in LTL?
A: F(a & F(a & Fb))

Q: What is "in some sequence visit a b and c in that order" in LTL?
A: F(a & F(b & Fc))

Q: What is "visit a then visit b then visit c then visit d" in LTL?
A: F(a & F(b & F(c & Fd)))

Q: What is "visit a b c d and h sequentially" in LTL?
A: F(a & F(b & F(c & F(d & Fh))))

Q: What is "go to a exactly once while avoiding b then go to b" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & Fb & (!a U (a U (!a U b)))

Q: What is "visit a exactly once while avoiding b and c then visit b exactly once while avoiding c finally visit c" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c)))

Q: What is "visit a then b then c and then d you can only visit each landmark once" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d)))

Q: What is "visit a then b then c then d and then h visit each landmark only once" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d))) & (!d U (d U (!d U h)))

Q: What is "go to a an infinite number of times" in LTL?
A: GFa

Q: What is "frequent a b and c infinitely in any order" in LTL?
A: GFa & GFb & GFc

Q: What is "frequent a b c and d infinitely in any order" in LTL?
A: GFa & GFb & GFc & GFd

Q: What is "frequent a b c d and h infinitely in any order" in LTL?
A: GFa & GFb & GFc & GFd & GFh

Q: What is "go to a and b infinitely often" in LTL?
A: GFa & GFb
