A: F(a & F(b & F(c & Fd)))

Q: What is "go to a then go to b then go to c then go to d finally go to h" in LTL?
A: F(a & F(b & F(c & F(d & Fh))))

A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc

Q: What is "go to a only once but keep away from b and then visit b but keep away from a" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & Fb & (!a U (a U (!a U b)))

Q: What is "make your way to c only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to a do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c)))

Q: What is "make your way to d only after going to c before that make your way to c only after going to b before that make your way to b only after going to a do not go back to the previous location you have visited while heading to the next" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d)))

Q: What is "do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited along the path never return to previous location you have been to" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh & (!a U (a U (!a U b))) & (!b U (b U (!b U c))) & (!c U (c U (!c U d))) & (!d U (d U (!d U h)))

A: GFa

Q: What is "visit a as many times as you want while avoiding b c and d then visit b as many times as you want while avoiding c and d then visit c as many times as you want while avoiding d finally visit d" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd

Q: What is "do not go to h until d is visited and do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited" in LTL?
A: (!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh
