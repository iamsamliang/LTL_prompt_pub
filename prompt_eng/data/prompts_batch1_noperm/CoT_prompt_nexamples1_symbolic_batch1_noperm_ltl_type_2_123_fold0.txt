Your task is to translate English instructions into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Q: What is "reach a" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "reach" specifies we must "eventually visit a". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". There is 1 landmark so we are done. The answer is "Fa".

Q: What is "visit b and a" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "visit" specifies we must "eventually visit a and b". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". There are 2 landmarks so we are done. The answer is "Fa & Fb".

Q: What is "visit c a and b in no specific order" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "visit" specifies we must "eventually visit a, b, and c". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". Repeat for the remaining parts. The answer is "Fa & Fb & Fc".

Q: What is "go to four locations a b d and c" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "go to" specifies we must "eventually visit a, b, c, and d". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". Repeat for the remaining parts. The answer is "Fa & Fb & Fc & Fd".

Q: What is "sometime visit a c b h and d" in LTL?
A: We must eventually visit some landmarks in any order. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "sometime visit" specifies we must "eventually visit a, b, c, d, and h". Examining each part, "eventually visit a" is "Fa". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". Repeat for the remaining parts. The answer is "Fa & Fb & Fc & Fd & Fh".

Q: What is "in strictly this order visit a then eventually visit b and finally eventually c" in LTL?
A: We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "in strictly this order" specifies we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit c but not until we visit b and we visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". "eventually visit c" is "Fc". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & Fc".

Q: What is "find b but not until you find a first" in LTL?
A: We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "until" specifies we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "eventually visit b" is "Fb". The answer is "(!b U a) & Fb".

Q: What is "go to a only after that go to b only then go to c and only then go to d" in LTL?
A: We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "only after" and "only then" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we eventually visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit d" is "Fd". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & Fd".

Q: What is "go to a and only go to b only after a is visited and then go to c only after a and b are both visited and then go to d only after a b and c are all visited and then go to h only after a b c and d are all visited" in LTL?
A: We eventually visit some landmarks in a certain order while we cannot visit some landmarks until we visit others first. Eventually is the "F" LTL operator. "only after" specify we only visit one landmark after visiting another. "We eventually visit h but not until we visit d and we visit d but not until we visit c and we visit c but not until we visit b and we eventually visit b but not until we visit a". Examining each part, "visit b but not until visit a" is "(!b U a)". "visit c but not until visit b" is "(!c U b)". Repeat for the remaining parts. "eventually visit h" is "Fh". The answer is "(!b U a) & (!c U b) & (!d U c) & (!h U d) & Fh".
