Your task is to translate English natural language instructions (NLI) into linear temporal logic (LTL).

Q: Translate the NLI “visit a and b in any order” to its LTL in prefix notation.
A: The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has two landmarks “a” and "b". It contains no temporal constraint on visiting "a" or "b". Looking at parts of the instruction, "in any order" implies that we can visit “a” and "b" in no particular order but that we eventually must visit both which requires the "F" operator. So the answer is “& F a F b”.

Q: Translate the NLI “go to a then go to b then go to c” to its LTL in prefix notation.
A: The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has three landmarks “a”, "b", and "c". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "then" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint. We first visit "a", then "b", and then "c". We must “go to a” at some point in time. This requires the "F" operator. We must visit other landmarks after "a" which requires the "&" operator. This corresponds to the prefix part “F & a”. Similarly, “then go to b” tells us we must visit “b" some time after visiting “a” which is the prefix part “F & b”. Lastly, “then go to c” tells us we must visit "c" some time after visiting "a" and "b" which is the prefix part “F c”. We combine the three parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “F & a F & b F c”.

Q: Translate the NLI “visit c but only after visiting b and visit b only after visiting a” to its LTL in prefix notation.
A: The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has three landmarks “a”, "b", and "c". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "after" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks. “visit c but only after visiting b” means we cannot go to “c” until we go to "b" which requires the "U" and "!" operator. There are landmarks to visit after "b" which requires "&". This is the prefix part “& U ! c b”. Similarly, “visit b only after visiting a” tells us we cannot visit “b" until we go to “a”. This is the prefix part “& U ! b a”. We must still visit "c" eventually which is the prefix part "F c". We combine the three parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “& U ! b a & U ! c b F c”.

Q: Translate the NLI “go to c after b go to b after going to a” to its LTL in prefix notation.
A: The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has three landmarks “a”, "b", and "c". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "after" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint. We first visit "a", then "b", and then "c". "go to c after b" implies we must visit "c" eventually after going to "b". This requires the "F" operator and corresponds to the prefix part “F c”. "go to b after going to a" imples we must visit "b" eventually after visiting "a". We also must visit "c" after "b" which requires the "&" operator. This results in the prefix part “F & b". We still have to visit "a" first which is the prefix part "F & a". We combine the three parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “F & a F & b F c”.

Q: Translate the NLI “make sure a b and c are visited infinitely” to its LTL in prefix notation.
A: The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has three landmarks “a”, "b", and "c". Looking at parts of the instruction, it contains no temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks as long as they are "visited infinitely". The landmarks only require that they are eventually visited again in the future. This requires the "F" operator. Visiting the landmarks "infinitely" in the future requires the "G" operator with "F". So the answer is “& G F a & G F b G F c”.

Q: Translate the NLI “do not go to d until c is visited and do not go to c until b is visited and do not go to b until a is visited” to its LTL in prefix notation.
A: The answer must be in prefix notation. The instruction has four landmarks “a”, "b", "c", and "d". Looking at parts of the instruction, the "until" phrases indicate there is a temporal constraint on visiting the landmarks. “do not go to d until c is visited” means we cannot go to “d” until we go to "c" which requires the "U" and "!" operator. There are landmarks to visit after "c" which requires "&". This is the prefix part “& U ! d c”. “do not go to c until b is visited” and "do not go to b until a is visited" follow the same reasoning with different landmarks. This is the prefix part “& U ! c b” and "& U ! b a", respectively. We must still visit "d" eventually which is the prefix part "F d". We combine the four parts while maintaining prefix notation. So the answer is “& U ! b a & U ! c b & U ! d c F d”.
